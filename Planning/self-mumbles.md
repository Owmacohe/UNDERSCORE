## The way to help them is to focus on your work

Concept for an NPC's motivation. So focused on work. From the outside, they appear distracted and hurtful, yet are performing this because they genuinely believe that hard work will aid those that they love (and probably themselves too). Their actions are *FUTILE*.



## I always check the song titles during the credits to see the name of the song that’s currently playing

I just do. It’s weird and I kinda don’t know why. Maybe it’s my way of giving back to the composers. They receive so little recognition. Why do we play these little games with ourselves? What would happen if we didn’t?



## The incidental details that make it past scrutinized production

Like stock photos, gradients, or textures. Stuff that’s either generated or copied. It’s curated, but not tuned so finely as logos, text, visual design, etc. What does it mean for something like that to slip past the cracks?



## Passage of time from the perspective of surfaces

What have they seen? What minute information in encoded onto them? On an atomic level, their existence is no different from ours. A game should be able to explore their materiality and perspective.



## Everyone here is you

Fundamentally, every person is the same. Truly and honestly. How do we strip that away? On this line of thought, life is more like one giant dream, each person inhabited by a single spread-out mind.



## Art exhibit outside the museum

Break the hegemony. Get weird and interactive. The colonial nature now extends outside of the hallowed halls.



## Carrying big things on the subway

It’s funny, and we should make a game about that. What are they carrying? What does it tell us about them? A glimpse into another life through its inconveniences.



## Politics has erased politics

I just miss when people would argue over toothpaste flavours, speaking policies, and traffic jams.



## World representing emotional arc

A very elegant and underutilized way to really dive deep into a character’s emotions. Tornadoes, politics, social collapse, green energy, and terramorphic geological changes.
