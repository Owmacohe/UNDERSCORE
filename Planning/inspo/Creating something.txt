[Audio transcript from a recording I took on my phone, at 12:52am, lying on my back as a little blue light flashes against my wall in the dark]

I want to create a work of art that means something to somebody. Because films and games and books, I have these things that matter to me. Individual things made by individual people. They matter to me, a lot, and they shape me. They change who you are and make you who you are. I want to, and I need to, create that for someone. It's imperative. I want to create something that someone will say 'this changed me, this made me think something, this made me part of who I am'. That would be the ultimate honour. I want to say something, but also nothing really. Because everything's already been said, just want to put it into context.
