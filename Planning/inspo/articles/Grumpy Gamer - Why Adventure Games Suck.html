<p>I wrote this back in 1989 while I was designing Monkey Island.  It is
 now the futuristic year of 2004 and we are all driving around in flying
 cars and wearing sliver jumps suits.  A lot has changed for Adventure 
Games as well, but unfortunately not in the right direction.</p>
<p>Adventure Games are officially dead.  I think this <a href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/77.html">article from Old Man Murray</a>
 (written in 2002) sums it up pretty well.  Make sure you read the whole
 thing, it starts out slow, but his conclusion could not be more true.</p>
<p>Some people will tell you that Adventure Games aren't really dead, 
they have just morphed into other forms, or that other genres have 
absorbed Adventure Games.  If this is true, they've done a pretty bad 
job of it.</p>
<p>I wrote this article to help fellow Adventure Games designers back in
 1989, but the RPG, FPS and RTS designers of 2004 could use a little of 
the self-proclaimed wisdom of the past.</p>
<p>As I read this some 15 years later, I'm not sure I agree with 
everything in here anymore.  I learned a lot from Monkey Island 1 and 2,
 plus countless kids Adventure Games at Humongous Entertainment.  At 
some point in the near future, I will do an annotated version of this 
article, talking about things that have changed, or were just plains 
wrong.  But in the meantime, there is something interesting on TV right 
now.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank <a href="http://electriceggplant.com/">David Fox</a> for passively-aggressively forcing me to post this.</p>
<h2>Why Adventure Games Suck And What We Can Do About It</h2>
<p>Copyright 1989, Ron Gilbert</p>
<p>Of all the different types of games, the ones I most enjoy playing 
are adventure/story games.  It is no surprise that this is also the 
genre for which I design.  I enjoy games in which the pace is slow and 
the reward is for thinking and figuring, rather than quick reflexes.  
The element that brings adventure games to life for me is the stories 
around which they are woven.  When done right, it is a form of 
storytelling that can be engrossing in a way that only interaction can 
bring.  The key here is "done right", which it seldom is.</p>
<p>One of my pet peeves is the recent trend to call story games 
"Interactive Movies."  They are interactive, but they are not movies.  
The fact that people want to call them movies just points out how lost 
we are.  What we need to do is to establish a genre for our works that 
we can call our own.  Movies came from stage plays, but the references 
are long lost and movies have come into their own.  The same thing needs
 to happen to story games.</p>
<p>The desire to call them Interactive Movies comes from a couple of 
places.  The first is Marketing.  It is the goal of narrow-minded 
marketing to place everything into a category so it will be 
recognizable.  These people feel that the closest things to story games 
are movies.  The other source for the name Interactive Movie is what I 
call "Hollywood Envy."  A great number of people in this business 
secretly (and not so secretly) wish they were making movies, not writing
 video games.  Knock it off!  If you really want to make movies, then go
 to film school and leave the game designing to people who want to make 
games.</p>
<p>Story games are not movies, but the two forms do share a great deal. 
 It is not fair to completely ignore movies.  We can learn a lot from 
them about telling stories in a visual medium.  However, it is important
 to realize that there are many more differences than similarities.  We 
have to choose what to borrow and what to discover for ourselves.  </p>
<p>The single biggest difference is interaction.  You can't interact 
with a movie.  You just sit in the theater and watch it.  In a story 
game, the player is given the freedom to explore the story.  But the 
player doesn't always do what the designer intended, and this causes 
problems.  It is hard to create a cohesive plot when you have no idea 
what part of the story the player will trip over next.  This problem 
calls for a special kind of storytelling, and we have just begun to 
scratch the surface of this art form.</p>
<p>There is a state of mind called "suspension of disbelief".  When you 
are watching a movie, or reading a good book, your mind falls into this 
state.  It occurs when you are pulled so completely into the story that 
you no longer realize you are in a movie theater or sitting at your 
couch, reading.  When the story starts to drag, or the plots begins to 
fall apart, the suspension of disbelief is lost.  You soon start looking
 around the theater, noticing the people in front of you or the green 
exit sign.  One way I judge a movie is by the number of times I realized
 I was in a theater.</p>
<p>The same is true of story games (as well as almost all other kinds of
 games).  As the story builds, we are pulled into the game and leave the
 real world behind.  As designers, our job is to keep people in this 
state for as long as possible.  Every time the player has to restore a 
saved game, or pound his head on the desk in frustration, the suspension
 of disbelief is gone.  At this time he is most likely to shut off the 
computer and go watch TV, at which point we all have lost.</p>
<p>I have created a set of rules of thumb that will minimize the loss of
 suspension of disbelief.  As with any set of rules, there are always 
exceptions.  In my designs, I hope that if these rules cannot be 
followed, it is for artistic reasons and not because I am too lazy to do
 it right.  In Maniac Mansion, in one place or another, I violated all 
but one of these rules.  Some of them were violated by design, others by
 sloppiness.  If I could redesign Maniac Mansion, all the violations 
would be removed and I'd have a much better game.</p>
<p>Some people say that following these rules makes the games too easy 
to play.  I disagree.  What makes most games tough to play is that the 
puzzles are arbitrary and unconnected.  Most are solved by chance or 
repetitive sessions of typing "light candle with match", "light paper 
with match", "light rug with match", until something happens.  This is 
not tough game play, this is masturbation.  I played one game that 
required the player to drop a bubble gum wrapper in a room in order to 
get a trap door to open (object names have been changed to protect the 
guilty).  What is the reasoning?  There is none.  It's an advanced 
puzzle, I was told.  </p>
<p>Here, then, are Gilbert's Rules of Thumb:</p>
<h2>End objective needs to be clear</h2>
<p>It's OK if the objective changes in mid-game, but at the beginning 
the player should have a clear vision as to what he or she is trying to 
accomplish.  Nothing is more frustrating than wandering around wondering
 what you should be doing and if what you have been doing is going to 
get you anywhere.  Situations where not knowing what's going on can be 
fun and an integral part of the game, but this is rare and difficult to 
pull off.</p>
<h2>Sub-goals need to be obvious</h2>
<p>Most good adventure games are broken up into many sub-goals.  Letting
 the player know at least the first sub-goal is essential in hooking 
them.  If the main goal is to rescue the prince, and the player is 
trapped on an island at the beginning of the game, have another 
character in the story tell them the first step: get off the island.  
This is just good storytelling.  Ben Kenobi pretty much laid out Luke's 
whole journey in the first twenty minutes of Star Wars.  This provided a
 way for the audience to follow the progress of the main character.  For
 someone not used to the repetitive head-banging of adventure games, 
this simple clue can mean the difference between finishing the game and 
giving up after the first hour.  It's very easy when designing to become
 blind to what the player doesn't know about your story.</p>
<h2>Live and learn</h2>
<p>As a rule, adventure games should be able to be played from beginning
 to end without "dying" or saving the game if the player is very careful
 and very observant.  It is bad design to put puzzles and situations 
into a game that require a player to die in order to learn what not to 
do next time.  This is not to say that all death situations should be 
designed out.  Danger is inherent in drama, but danger should be 
survivable if the player is clever.</p>
<p>As an exercise, take one complete path through a story game and then 
tell it to someone else, as if it were a standard story.  If you find 
places where the main character could not have known a piece of 
information that was used (the character who learned it died in a 
previous game), then there is a hole in the plot.  </p>
<h2>Backwards Puzzles</h2>
<p>The backwards puzzle is probably the one thing that bugs me more than
 anything else about adventure games.  I have created my share of them; 
and as with most design flaws, it's easier to leave them in than to 
redesign them.  The backwards puzzle occurs when the solution is found 
before the problem.  Ideally, the crevice should be found before the 
rope that allows the player to descend.  What this does in the player's 
mind is set up a challenge.  He knows he need to get down the crevice, 
but there is no route.  Now the player has a task in mind as he 
continues to search.  When a rope is spotted, a light goes on in his 
head and the puzzle falls into place.  For a player, when the design 
works, there is nothing like that experience.</p>
<h2>I forgot to pick it up</h2>
<p>This is really part of the backwards puzzle rule, but in the worst 
way.  Never require a player to pick up an item that is used later in 
the game if she can't go back and get it when it is needed.  It is very 
frustrating to learn that a seemingly insignificant object is needed, 
and the only way to get it is to start over or go back to a saved game. 
 From the player's point of view, there was no reason for picking it up 
in the first place.  Some designers have actually defended this practice
 by saying that, "adventure games players know to pick up everything."  
This is a cop-out.  If the jar of water needs to be used on the 
spaceship and it can only be found on the planet, create a use for it on
 the planet that guarantees it will be picked up.  If the time between 
the two uses is long enough, you can be almost guaranteed that the 
player forgot she even had the object.</p>
<p>The other way around this problem is to give the player hints about 
what she might need to pick up.  If the aliens on the planet suggest 
that the player find water before returning to the ship, and the player 
ignores this advice, then failure is her own fault.  </p>
<h2>Puzzles should advance the story</h2>
<p>There is nothing more frustrating than solving pointless puzzle after
 pointless puzzle.  Each puzzle solved should bring the player closer to
 understanding the story and game.  It should be somewhat clear how 
solving this puzzle brings the player closer to the immediate goal.  
What a waste of time and energy for the designer and player if all the 
puzzle does is slow the progress of the game.</p>
<h2>Real time is bad drama</h2>
<p>One of the most important keys to drama is timing.  Anyone who has 
designed a story game knows that the player rarely does anything at the 
right time or in the right order.  If we let the game run on a clock 
that is independent from the player's actions, we are going to be 
guaranteed that few things will happen with dramatic timing.  When 
Indiana Jones rolled under the closing stone door and grabbed his hat 
just in time, it sent a chill and a cheer through everyone in the 
audience.  If that scene had been done in a standard adventure game, the
 player would have been killed the first four times he tried to make it 
under the door.  The next six times the player would have been too late 
to grab the hat.  Is this good drama?  Not likely.  The key is to use 
Hollywood time, not real time.  Give the player some slack when doing 
time-based puzzles.  Try to watch for intent.  If the player is working 
towards the solution and almost ready to complete it, wait.  Wait until 
the hat is grabbed, then slam the door down.  The player thinks they 
"just made it" and consequently a much greater number of players get the
 rush and excitement.  When designing time puzzles I like to divide the 
time into three categories.  10% of the players will do the puzzle so 
fast and efficiently that they will finish with time to spare.  Another 
10% will take too much time and fail, which leaves 80% of the people to 
brush through in the nick of time.</p>
<h2>Incremental reward</h2>
<p>The player needs to know that she is achieving.  The fastest way to 
turn a player off is to let the game drag on with no advancement.  This 
is especially true for people who are playing adventure games for the 
first time.  In graphics adventures the reward often comes in the form 
of seeing new areas of the game.  New graphics and characters are often 
all that is needed to keep people playing.  Of course, if we are trying 
to tell a story, then revealing new plot elements and twists can be of 
equal or greater value.</p>
<h2>Arbitrary puzzles</h2>
<p>Puzzles and their solutions need to make sense.  They don't have to 
be obvious, just make sense.  The best reaction after solving a tough 
puzzle should be, "Of course, why didn't I think of that sooner!"  The 
worst, and most often heard after being told the solution is, "I never 
would have gotten that!"  If the solution can only be reached by trial 
and error or plain luck, it's a bad puzzle. </p>
<h2>Reward Intent</h2>
<p>The object of these games is to have fun.  Figure out what the player
 is trying to do.  If it is what the game wants, then help the player 
along and let it happen.  The most common place this fails is in playing
 a meta-game called "second guess the parser."  If there is an object on
 the screen that looks like a box, but the parser is waiting for it to 
be called a mailbox, the player is going to spend a lot of time trying 
to get the game to do a task that should be transparent.  In 
parser-driven games, the key is to have lots of synonyms for objects.  
If the game is a graphics adventure, check proximity of the player's 
character.  If the player is standing right next to something, chances 
are they are trying to manipulate it.  If you give the player the 
benefit of the doubt, the game will be right more than wrong.  On one 
occasion, I don't know how much time I spent trying to tie a string on 
the end of a stick.  I finally gave up, not knowing if I was wording the
 sentence wrong or if it was not part of the design.  As it turned out, I
 was wording it wrong.</p>
<h2>Unconnected events</h2>
<p>In order to pace events, some games lock out sections until certain 
events have happened.  There is nothing wrong with this, it is almost a 
necessity.  The problem comes when the event that opens the new section 
of the world is unconnected.  If the designer wants to make sure that 
six objects have been picked up before opening a secret door, make sure 
that there is a reason why those six objects would affect the door.  If a
 player has only picked up five of the objects and is waiting for the 
door to open (or worse yet, trying to find a way to open the door), the 
act of getting the flashlight is not going to make any sense in relation
 to the door opening.</p>
<h2>Give the player options</h2>
<p>A lot of story games employ a technique that can best be described as
 caging the player.  This occurs when the player is required to solve a 
small set of puzzles in order to advance to the next section of the 
game, at which point she is presented with another small set of puzzles.
  Once these puzzles are solved, in a seemingly endless series of cages,
 the player enters the next section.  This can be particularly 
frustrating if the player is unable to solve a particular puzzle.  The 
areas to explore tend to be small, so the only activity is walking 
around trying to find the one solution out.</p>
<p>Try to imagine this type of puzzle as a cage the player is caught in,
 and the only way out is to find the key.  Once the key is found, the 
player finds herself in another cage.  A better way to approach 
designing this is to think of the player as outside the cages, and the 
puzzles as locked up within.  In this model, the player has a lot more 
options about what to do next.  She can select from a wide variety of 
cages to open.  If the solution to one puzzle stumps her, she can go on 
to another, thus increasing the amount of useful activity going on.  </p>
<p>Of course, you will want some puzzles that lock out areas of the 
game, but the areas should be fairly large and interesting unto 
themselves.  A good indicator of the cage syndrome is how linear the 
game is.  If the plot follows a very strict line, chances are the 
designer is caging the player along the path.  It's not easy to uncage a
 game, it requires some careful attention to the plot as seen from 
players coming at the story from different directions.  The easiest way 
is to create different interactions for a given situation depending on 
the order encountered.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If I could change the world, there are a few things I would do, and 
quite frankly none of them have anything to do with computers or games. 
 But since this article is about games?  </p>
<p>The first thing I'd do is get rid of save games.  If there have to be
 save games, I would use them only when it was time to quit playing 
until the next day.  Save games should not be a part of game play.  This
 leads to sloppy design.  As a challenge, think about how you would 
design a game differently if there were no save games.  If you ever have
 the pleasure of watching a non-gameplayer playing an adventure game you
 will notice they treat save game very differently then the experienced 
user.  Some start using it as a defense mechanism only after being 
slapped in the face by the game a few times, the rest just stop playing.
  </p>
<p>The second thing I'd change would be the price.  For between forty 
and fifty dollars a game, people expect a lot of play for their money.  
This rarely leads to huge, deep games, but rather time-wasting puzzles 
and mazes.  If the designer ever thinks the game might be too short, he 
throws in another puzzle or two.  These also tend to be the worst 
thought-out and most painful to solve.  If I could have my way, I'd 
design games that were meant to be played in four to five hours.  The 
games would be of the same scope that I currently design, I'd just 
remove the silly time-wasting puzzles and take the player for an intense
 ride.  The experience they would leave with would be much more 
entertaining and a lot less frustrating.  The games would still be 
challenging, but not at the expense of the players patience.  </p>
<p>If any type of game is going to bridge the gap between games and 
storytelling, it is most likely going to be adventure games.  They will 
become less puzzle solving and more story telling, it is the blueprint 
the future will be made from.  The thing we cannot forget is that we are
 here to entertain, and for most people, entertainment does not consist 
of nights and weekends filled with frustration.  The average American 
spends most of the day failing at the office, the last thing he wants to
 do is come home and fail while trying to relax and be entertained.</p></div><hr>

other signals. Even if the item or gimmick to be utilized is 
significant. Very frustrating for someone who grew up with games where 
the point of having different NPCs was for them to say different things.<br></div>

	<div class="text">It's weird how there's a lot less parser wrestling 
when playing a text adventure like Spider and Web over a mixed 
parser/graphical adventure like King's Quest â€” because if you see the 
text call it a "mailbox" you know to call it a mailbox, but if you see 
an image of a box you don't know what to call it.<br><br>The other thing
 I wanted to add was now that all of these have been addressed by Monkey
 Island and similar games, to me the one annoying thing is that when I 
don't know which of these two modes I'm in:<br><br>"I have everything I need, I just need to think more, I can stop searching everywhere for missed items"<br>vs<br>"I don't have everything yet, I should go exploring, or go over my steps to see if I missed a location or item".<br><br>This
 is why the crevice/rope example kinda bugs me. If I come to the crevice
 before I have the rope I might be like "Oh, there must be some way 
down, I just need to think and look more closely right here" or I might 
be like "Oh gosh darn it, I must've missed a rope somewhere, I need to 
go back and search". Idk. I really really love puzzles where I have 
everything, I just know I need to, uh, somehow try to figure it out. And
 exploring and searching for items is also fun, as long as I know I'm 
getting it all. The scary frustrating "uh... did I get everything?" part
 of adventure games is the most annoying part.<br><br>I was also 
thinking about this in context of hint systems. I'd like to ask the 
game: "Do I have everything to do X?" and it could say "No, go search 
more" or "No, you need to do some other puzzles first, come back to this
 later" (the mouse holes in Day of the Tentacle) and "Yes, just start 
thinking!"<br></div>

	<div class="text">Adam, the solution to the "forgot to pick up" is to 
just require the item in order to move zones. If you need the water on 
the space ship, just make it so that you either:<br><br>1. can get the water on board the space ship<br>2. need the water in order to get onto the space ship (and can't get rid of it)<br>3. need something else â€” that comes with receiving water, attached to it â€” in order to get onto the space ship<br><br>Good luckâ™¥<br></div>

	<div class="text">I think Sandra's idea of a hint system that realizes 
and just tells you to search, talk (and listen) or just to think is 
great. I would have preferred that over the hint system in e.g. 
thimbleweed park which I needed a couple of times in order to solve the 
game.<br></div>

	<div class="text">Hi, a big adventure game fan here. Mr. Gilbert, thank
 you for all of your great games that shaped my imagination as a kid and
 very much set me on the way of doing art myself.<br>But i do not agree that adventure games are dead. Lest's just have a look at the AGS archives: <br><a href="https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/site/games/allgames/1/date/desc/" rel="nofollow">https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/site/games/allgames/1/date/desc/</a><br>July
 2019: 24 pages of fan made games, each page with about a 100 games. 
Seems like quite a lively fanbase. In my opinion, some sort of classic 
adventure games will stumble on, as long as there are kids and adults, 
that prefer reason, rational thinking and puzzles, over adrenaline 
pumped, mindless action. We will probably always be a minorty, but we 
will persist, just like you still have players of slower and more 
thinking games like chess, cards or Warhammer like strategies, even in 
the age when most people seem to prefer the fast paced and more primal 
instincts action entertainment.<br><br>Cheers and hope to see some more of your adventure games in the future.<br></div>

	<div class="text">Great post. Thanks for sharing Ron!<br><br>I'm not sure I 100% agree with the "give player options" section, but I would like to know your opinion on a specific example.<br><br>Spoiler
 alert: this example is about The Secret of Monkey Island. I tried to 
avoid sharing information required to solve any puzzles, but I wanted to
 contextualize the example a little bit.<br><br>I recently finished 
playing Monkey Island (what a wonderful game), and there is a part, near
 the end of the game, where being caged would have helped me know 
definitely that there's no other way to make progress in the game.<br><br>When
 you are in the ghost ship, it is obvious that you need the key that is 
in the captain's room, but it took me some time to figure out how to get
 it. After some failed attempts I even went back to the cannibals 
village trying to find an item that could help me do that.<br><br>I felt
 that allowing the player to leave the ship without the root was 
counterproductive because it potentially let the player waste time 
without any good reason.<br><br>What do you think of this case?<br></div>

	<div class="text">I was pointed to this blog entry when trying to find 
the inventor of what I called the "you cannot fail" rule (I defined it 
as " you cannot die + you cannot put yourself in a situation that you 
cannot resolve anymore"). It's clearly spelled out here (if not in the 
same terms, as a combination of "no saves"/"no need to die"/"I forgot to
 pick up").<br><br> My earliest example is Loom, from '89. Mr. Gilbert 
is not listed in its Wikipedia page, but I wonder if he was somehow 
involved. From that year is also The Last Crusade, where you can die 
only in very controlled ways, which do lists Mr. Gilbert.<br><br>I'm collecting information about the games of that era in this website: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/you-cannot-fail-rule/" rel="nofollow">https://sites.google.com/view/you-cannot-fail-rule/</a>
 . I wonder if Mr. Gilbert has hindsight on who (himself?) consciously 
decided to adopt this rule, in a soft or hard way, for these and later 
games. I'm also interested in finding out even earlier examples.<br><br>Very insightful article, all in all.<br></div>

celebrating Monkey Island's 30th anniversary. I bought every single 
Lucasarts adventure game back in the day, and Monkey Island was what got
 me into gaming. I see how this 1989 article turned into the famous 
Lucasarts rules for adventure games: You can't die, and you can't get 
into a dead end. <br><br>I wonder if modern adventure game designers 
should try to counter something that didn't exist back then: free online
 walk-throughs. The seduction is there when you hit a difficult puzzle.<br></div>

essential defense mechanism against high frequency of failing a

 for the designer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese anime adventure games often don't
 come with save game.&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one am frustrated especially

article made by a small indie game dev in Medium regarding the state of 
Point and Click Adventure Games.<br>(<a href="https://medium.com/backwoods/flaws-of-an-undead-genre-whats-wrong-with-point-click-adventures-b3cb93a4c364" rel="nofollow">https://medium.com/backwoods/flaws-of-an-undead-genre-whats-wrong-with-point-click-adventures-b3cb93a4c364</a>)<br>Seeing
 the contrast of what you said and the present is definitely an eye 
opener. Especially, the part where you said adventure games has a trend 
of being called an Interactive Movie. Did I mentioned I found this 
article because of a game called At Dead Of Night. It's interesting how 
that game punishes you for using hints too many times. Anyway, as to how
 is the state of adventure games at the moment. I could only see it as 
one of those things where it still has a following even if the interest 
has been lost, it has its own niche without always trying to be a cult 
classic, sort of situation. To say that it's a genre that has lost its 
touch depends on the perception of what makes an adventure game so 
great. And that is how do we interact with the characters, the items, 
the exploration, and the story in those world.</div>

	<div class="text">Decades later this all still rings true. Adventure 
Games sound like they should be really fun, yet they are almost all 
aggravating. I played part of Kings Quest 6 and gave up halfway through 
because of how atrociously stupid it was. And this is supposedly the 
good one?! (and it's not just that's it's old/dated - I'm old school and
 a love a lot of older games - it's just a flat-out poorly-designed 
crapfest).<br><br>{{ The best reaction after solving a tough puzzle 
should be, "Of course, why didn't I think of that sooner!" The worst, 
and most often heard after being told the solution is, "I never would 
have gotten that!" If the solution can only be reached by trial and 
error or plain luck, it's a bad puzzle. }}<br><br>^ This is so true. 
Most Adventure Game puzzle solutions are like playing Phoebeball with 
the Designer, if anyone remembers this episode of Friends.<br><br>Phoebe: Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favorite thing about trees?<br>Monica: TheyÂ´re green?<br>Phoebe: Good! Good! Five points! Alright, Joey, same question.<br>Joey: Uhh, theyÂ´re tall.<br>Phoebe: Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for LEAFY!<br>Monica: ThatÂ´s not even a game!</div>

	<div class="text">I found this via a YT doc about Monkey Island and 
it's great. I am a magician who also makes escape rooms and so much of 
what was said here way back when also applies to the creation of escape 
rooms since they are essentially live action video games.<br><br>More people need to read this.</div>

	<div class="text">Thank you for this insight, I hope to apply it 
myself. Also monkey island was a great game that I fondly remember from 
my childhood. May your ripples become waves Ron, and may we all strive 
to make ripples.</div>

implemented in Monkey 1 and 2 via Stan best. Not only that one cannot 
forget to pick up compass or hankie, one is sure as hell to have

	<div class="text">I agree that save games should not be needed to play 
or solve a game. But I still want them as bookmarks for places and 
situation I might want to revisit. For instance, in Thimbleweed Park I 
can go play the arcade games or look at some of the beautiful artwork 
whenever I like.</div>

	<div class="text">Thank you for this article. I came across the article
 while researching best practices to plan out a small point and click 
(LeChuck knows I'm not experienced enough to do anything major.)<br><br>I
 can't help but smile at the remark about the price vs game time. It 
makes me think back to the end of Monkey Island when Guybrush can be 
made to break the 4th wall one last time!</div>

	<div class="text">I agree with numerous points and disagree with several other points. <br><br>I
 agree that dead ends are aggravating, especially when you don't know 
you've accidentally locked yourself into one and you don't find out till
 hours later. I agree that games should have a clear goal in mind and 
the player should know what they are trying to accomplish. I agree that 
timers are VERY irritating, and in most games, not just adventure games.
 I also agree that backwards puzzles 'tend' to be annoying. As for the 
other things, well...<br><br>I completely and utterly disagree with the 
idea of there not being save games. Some adventure games are 6, 8, 10, 
or even 12 hours long, given a player's cleverness or willingness to 
look up some hints. Having no save games is just, honestly, stupid. As 
someone who's older and doesn't have an entire afternoon and evening to 
sit undisturbed playing a video game, save games allow me to break up 
the game so I can play it intermittently. I don't care in the slightest 
how this may "break up the momentum of the storytelling", it's an 
adventure game, the only momentum it has is the momentum created by how 
quickly the player is solving the puzzles. I personally would much 
rather enjoy a 20 hour long adventure game that I played over the course
 of a week or month, than some 3 or 4 hour game that I crunched out 
after dinner.<br><br>I disagree with every puzzle needing to advance the
 story. I think there should be a number of optional puzzles and easter 
egg puzzles that reward the player in other ways, such as points towards
 100% completion, or secret or unrelated segments/events. Adventure 
games are about exploration just as much as they are about story and 
plot. If you don't reward player exploration and experimentation, you're
 doing adventure games just as wrong as if you were to have next to no 
story to interest the player.<br><br>And lastly, I disagree with player 
death. One of the key criticisms I have of LucasArts and Monkey Island 
in general is nearly the complete lack of death in any of the games. 
It's fine to have the oddball game here and there not include it, but to
 make it an active design decision just sucks the pressure out of the 
whole experience. Solving a puzzle or interaction without any risk 
attached is a hollow victory. If the only thing standing between me and 
victory is an endless supply of time, I'm are just as likely to become 
bored and lose interest as I would if I was constantly dying over and 
over again. There needs to be some gravity to the situation. The player 
needs to know the importance of their decisions. If you take away the 
fear of your character dying in humiliating or exaggerated ways, then 
you are treating the player like a child, and while you say that the 
average player wants to come home and relax and be entertained, they can
 certainly do that by watching a movie. If they want to come home and 
play a "game", which by definition is meant to offer an challenge to the
 one involved that they must overcome, not being able to fail said 
challenge is the most patronizing things you can do to a player, which 
is probably why Sierra adventure games repeatedly outsold LucasArts 
titles.<br><br>Overall an interesting article though. The purposely 
provocative title is certainly an eye-catcher, and is definitely a 
sympathy most people held back in the late 90's and 2000's. Though, now 
in the 2010's and beyond, people are taking a more loving eye to the 
genre, creating a large ground-swell of people rediscovering the titles 
and enjoying them warts and all. First adventure game I ever played was 
Zork, and it was the first game that convinced me that video games could
 be about more than just action and violence, while keeping the player 
engaged and interacting with the world in meaningful ways.</div>
