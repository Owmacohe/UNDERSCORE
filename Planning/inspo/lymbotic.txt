i'm floating
lymbotic between worlds

twisted it seems in the shadows of
two colossal celestial bodies
pillars of society and idyllic passages of time

i hate this place
this in between feeling
wrenched as if by force
from a romantic and blissfully ignorant window

i am changing, aiming
and in this space
i am unfamiliar even to myself

i know i will find a pace, a place
but what will life mean to my perception of it then?
i like who i am
i don't want (to) change
