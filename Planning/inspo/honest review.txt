this blanket is, too warm
for this room

but it's okay

.
.
.
.
.
.
.

my body tells me that i'm too warm, that i'm sweating

but that's okay

.
.
.

i can feel
the individual digits

and muscles and skin creases in my hands

each detail, part
each sinew

as well as the creases in the fake leather of my headphones

.
.
.
.
.
.
.

if there were grass here i would look at it

.
.
.
.
.
.

i need more time

to think
and think about experiencing

not because it, grants me anything

not because it gives boons to me or anyone else

simply for the very act of experiencing
it must be done

and yet there is, so much
to experience

it must be experienced
for it exists

but, is that in itself a form of experience?

i suppose i
may not have a pregorative to
catalog
experience
learn

as much as i can but
something

tells me that it's important

at least to me

.
.
.

I Hope That I Do Not Fear Death

but i honestly can't say for sure

.
.
.
.

i'd like to think that
when i die

i'll maybe have a momentary
thought of panic
worrying about appreciation for
experience
moment

feeling

as i am now

that is a possibility

but i hope that i console myself, i remind myself and
well, situate, i suppose

in the rememberance that

it's okay

.
.
.

i will never attain that
elusive goal

and that's okay

not because
it's better not to

but simply that

factually

it's
it's impossible

.
.
.
.
.

many don't understand

why
one would want to

well, live forever's not the right word, but
be in constant experience(?)

or even not in constant experience, but
eventual
total experience

i suppose that's understandable

but i guess that
quote unquote
living forever

is a possible way of attaining that
though

that in itself is a pipe dream

.
.
.

or is it?

if you had time
access to the full spectrum that it is
and

infinite time yourself
infinite patience

it could be done

.
.
.
.
.
.
.

should i be granted that ability

i would have no choice

.
.
.
.
.
.
.

so in a sense yeah

one could want to live forever, but not
living forever
or

continue

yeah
living forever

is not the goal
it's nowhere near the goal

it's one part of a gateway to
the goal

.
.
.
.
.

and so i suppose is that it's simply only
one part

it would be futile

in the end

simply
purely
only just

living forever

is uh

it's one part of the puzzle

and in that sense
given the, ability to live forever

barring of course any external
wants
needs
thoughts

would be no different than
living a mortal life

.
.
.

i realize now that i'm holding mt thumb

and pressing my pinky and index finger
ring finger sorry, rather

pinching it between my thumb and forefinger
and pushing my thumb into my palm

i let go

.
.
.
.

.
.
.

to quote
indirectly

this will all be wiped away by tomorrow
