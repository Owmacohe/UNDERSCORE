# Cocoon



numbing blue light and the whispering of cars
a closed shutter-box to lock oneself inside of
airtight seal made of crinkly pop vinyl luminance

though juvenile, it works terrible wonders
soft nest, harsh nest, one that bites and tugs
cradles intoxication, nurtures it slowly

and how now to breathe amid the haze
climbing from the spikes and the pillows
unwrapping the cocoon of late nights

letting all the warm colours flow in
metamorphizing
i suppose
