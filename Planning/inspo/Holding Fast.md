Shimmying down the passage of time
The flow and structure unending, but just gentle enough
For an awareness of its approach

Grabbing on here and there
Letting go and passing
Memories and experiences go tumbling by

A deep breath, and a concentration on the grasp
Firm hand planted in the soil of happenstance
The centring of oneself through chaos
