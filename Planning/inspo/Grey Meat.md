# Grey Meat



When the time comes
When satin veils tumble knowingly down
And my eyes roll back to darkness

Will you take care of my brain?

Will you pull its weight, lifeless, from my skull?
*Dust it off?*
*Give it a shine?*

Will you scoop out its thoughts?
Its grinning smiles and anchored fears
Its delights and shuddering knowledge

Will you fill its cracks and grooves with old ash and bits of moss?
Will you gild it in polished gold?
Encrust its surface with garnets and deers' teeth?

*And will you let it grow dull?*
Sinking and sunken in the palm of the hand of the world?

Become grey meat for the earth

And when you bury it, deep and dark in the soil
*When you shut the hatch*
*Snuff out the light*

Will you let the waxing sounds ring endlessly within it?

Will it dream still?
*Will it sleep?*
