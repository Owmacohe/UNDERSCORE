# Unwinding



It comes first warbling out from backdoors
Vacant windows and unswept corners
Wraps itself around the wavering souls
The stunted figures in stunted houses

Holds them tight, perhaps too tight
Familiar in its forcefulness
Gentle hands scoop around the spinal cord
Latching deep in the flesh, and yank!

Then it falls, tumbling from the tongue
Contaminated thoughts pouring out
With a new face and a new shine
As words and deeds, cruelty and solitude

It wriggles itself into idle twitching hands
Settles into the reigns and the seat
And gets to work so very, very busy
Unwinding all the people
