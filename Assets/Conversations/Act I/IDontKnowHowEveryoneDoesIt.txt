[START]
Can I confide something in you? Something that seems to underscore every thought in my head.

[2]
Why so eager to hear?

[0,1,20]
I don't know how anyone does it.
Their lives, spinning like comets through the trajectories of life. I wonder, how brightly does my own cosmic flare glow?

[00,10,200]
Thank you. So much. I thought I was alone.

[01,11,201]
Figures as much. No one's a protagonist.

[02,12,202]
I see myself.

[000,100,2000,010,110,2010]
Good. Here's a passing thought: Who does everyone else talk to when they die?

[020,120,2020,21]
It's always been you and me. That voice inside your head. The silent confidant, the stoic therapist, the listening preacher.

[0200,1200,20200,210]
It's what we did in life. Why stop now?

[0201,1201,20201,211]
I know you have. It's why you're here now too.

[START]
I guess so...

[START]
Yes.

[START]
I need you to. Please.

A chance to comfort someone else for a change.

[2:0.3]
A thought that there might be someone else here besides me.

[0,1,20:-0.2,0,0.2]
I see you.

[0,1,20]
I don't see you.

[0,1,20]
Do you see me?

[00,10,200,01,11,201]
I'm beginning to understand.

[02,12,202]
I don't understand.

[020,120,2020,21]
Then why pretend with all these conversations?

[020,120,2020,21]
I've been there for you too.
