[START]
Sooner or later it had to happen.
Heart attack, big fall, car crash. The list goes on.
It sucks. It really does. I'm sorry for you.
But we've had some good times I hope.
And now you're dead.
<br>
Do you still feel the pull?

[0]
I expected as much. Enjoy purgatory.
There are more and more like you everyday.
Want to take a peek inside?

[1]
Either you're lying or you've broken something deep inside. And lying in this place is... difficult.
<br>
Maybe a little look inside would help to get things stirring again.

[01]
I don't really know. This is my first time too.
But it's okay, we'll stick together.
Right?

[02]
As long as you need.

[10]
I know you need to sleep.
You will. And it'll be okay.
Just hold on a little longer for me.
This place will do you good.

[11]
A lot.

[00,010,020,100,110,12]
I know you're eager to get going. To move beyond this stagnant place, to feast halls and angelic clouds. That's coming. You'll find this worthwhile.
<br>
You know all those little moments that you forgot about? The work that went unnoticed? We're here to reward you for that. You deserve it for so much effort.

Yes.

What's inside?

[0]
How long do I have to be here?

[01]
Right.

[02]
...

[1]
I can't go back.

[1]
Will it hurt?

[1]
Let me in.

[10]
Okay.

[11]
Bring it on.
