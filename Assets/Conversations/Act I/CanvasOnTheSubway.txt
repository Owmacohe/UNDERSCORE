[START]
Three months ago, you were carrying a canvas back home with you on the subway. It was heavy, and extremely eye-catching. People were definitely staring.
<br>
Do you remember that?

[0,210]
How did that make you feel?

[1,20]
That's okay. These things will come back as you focus on them. Nothing is lost, even in death.
<br>
Are you sure you don't remember anything?

[2]
Isn't this what you're here for? Recognition?
For someone to finally just get it?

[21]
Then let me in.

[00,2100]
You were! No one would ever know the work you put into that painting. They would only know its content, when unravelled.
<br>
The interested yet dull eyes of those around you were obvious enough.

[01,2101,10,200]
The weight of the wood and fabric beneath your fingers was greater than any yoke or binding contract. It's okay, that weight's gone now.

[12,202]
You were worried for the watercolours. They drip drip drained so easily. All that work, washed away.
<br>
It's okay, we shared that loss together, even if you weren't aware at the time.

[11,201,211]
Then I can't help you. If I may, let me leave you with this wisdom:
<br>
You are dead. Take advantage of that fact, and breathe.

[000,21000,010,21010,100,2000,120,2020]
The pleasure is mine. There is more I can do to help, however. It's time to move on.
<br>
What about this memory would you like us to forget?

[0000,210000,0100,210100,1000,20000,1200,20200,0001,210001,0101,210101,1001,20001,1201,20201,0002,210002,0102,210102,1002,20002,1202,20202]
It is done.
<br>
Keep moving.

[START]
I think so.

[START]
It's too hazy to look back that far.

[START]
What does it matter?

[2]
I don't know why I'm here.

[2]
That's what I keep telling myself.

[21]
Okay.

[21:-0.3]
No.

[0,210]
I remember I was so excited.

[0,210,1,20]
I remember I was tired.

[1,20:-0.3]
Nothing. It's gone. It's all gone.

[1,20]
I remember it was raining.

[00,2100,01,2101,10,200,12,202]
Thank you.

[000,21000,010,21010,100,2000,120,2020:0.1]
What I saw.

[000,21000,010,21010,100,2000,120,2020:0.5]
How I felt.

[000,21000,010,21010,100,2000,120,2020:0.3]
What happened.
