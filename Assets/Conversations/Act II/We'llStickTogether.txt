Am I dead?

[00]
Yes.

[000]
What's inside?

[200]
Bye.


[0000]
Right.

[1,01,001,0001]
Oh, sorry. Got a little confused there. What were we talking about?

[10,010,0010,00010]
I can't get it out of my head either.

[11,011,0011,00011]
Okay.

[12,012,0012,00012]
Only if you're me.

[100,0100,00100,000100,101,0101,00101,000101]
Only in dreams.

Sooner or later it had to happen.
Heart attack, big fall, car crash.

It sucks, it really does. I'm sorry for you.
<br>
Do you still feel the pull?

[00]
I expected as much. Enjoy purgatory.
Want to take a peek inside?

[20]
Bye I guess.

[000:0.2]
It's complicated. A bit of you, a bit of me.
But it's okay, we'll stick together.
Right?

[1,01,001,0001]
Huh. DÃ©ja vu.

[1,01,001,0001]
Nevermind.

[1,01,001,0001:0:1]
Are you me?

[10,010,0010,00010]
Have we been to this place before?

[10,010,0010,00010:0.2]
Do you think this is what we've been looking for all along?
