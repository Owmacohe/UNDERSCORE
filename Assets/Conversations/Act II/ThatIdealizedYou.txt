[START]
I've been waiting so long for you.
I truly never thought we'd meet face to face.

[0]
You'll forgive me for being human. My worries tend to get the best of me.

[1]
I can't remember exactly. Sometime during adolescence.
<br>
I created you to prop up loneliness.

[2]
I'd always hoped you'd have as much agency as I do. I wanted a friend, so I made one.

[00]
Are you mad at me for doubting your existence?

[01]
I know. I do. I'm sorry.
<br>
But... part of you knows that deep down, you and I, we're the same.

[10,20]
It's complicated. I should go.

[11,21]
You're the one who understood. Who got it. Who suffered with me.
<br>
That idealized you who loved me.

[010]
If you don't understand, I can't explain it to you. Keep moving.

[011]
We all matter differently to different people.

[000,110,210]
It is! This all is.
But as part of that, it needs to be for me too. That's how being human works.

[100,200,101,201,102,202]
Maybe it's okay to believe that we needed each other.

[START]
You didn't have faith that your actions actually had meaning?

[START]
When did you start waiting?

[START:0:0.2]
I felt the same way.

[0]
I understand.

[0]
I can't. You were always there for me.

[1,2:-0.5]
No, that's not right. I created you.

[1,2:0.5:1]
Who am I?

[00]
Just disappointed. Feels weird to think this isn't all for me after all.

[01:-0.5]
That's Jungian garbage.

[01:0.3:0.5]
I think I get that.

[10,20]
Please, don't leave me.

[10,20]
My head hurts.

[10,20]
I need to keep moving as well.

[11,21]
Feels weird to think this isn't all for me after all.
