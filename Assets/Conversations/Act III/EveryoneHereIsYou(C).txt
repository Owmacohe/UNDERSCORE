[START]
Do you understand yet?

[0]
I need to know if you're ready to move on.

[2]
Please, illuminate me.
While subjective, there are correct answers.

[00]
But... but how can I know you are?

[01,1]
Perhaps that's the cosmic irony of it all. Though the austerity of this place rings true, it's fundamentally no different from our waking world.

[20,23]
I refuse to believe it. This place is seamless. Perfect. Utterly distinct from waking life. There are correct choices.

[21]
That's... true. To some extent. That's what you're here for, but that's not what you're supposed to understand.

[22]
Yes, very good. You are not special. But it's because of this fact that I love you so much. You remind me of me.

[000,001]
That's not how it works! I'm the final test! The bulwark before release! I...
I...
<br>
Okay.

[010,10,200,230]
I don't know what to say. You're correct, but I have no test for this. No measure for understanding.

[221]
I understand. It's okay. It's a difficult thing to come to terms with.

[0000,0010,0100,100,2000,2300]
I've been going for so long. Funneling you again and again through the cycle. Maybe you're right. Maybe it's time this all stops.

[0101,101,2001,2301,201,231,210]
You were truly and utterly so close.

[220,2210]
Now you get to breathe. No more lessons, so more love, no more understanding.
<br>
Just go.

[00000,00100,01000,1000,20000,23000]
I'm releasing you. You're free. But... I'm also releasing myself. No more comforting the dead. We all deserve nothingness.

[01010,1010,20010,23010,2010,2310,2100]
Now you restart. You are reborn.
You keep moving.
<br>
Until you finally understand.

[2200,22100]
You're free.

[000000,001000,010000,10000,200000,230000,000001,001001,010001,10001,200001,230001,000002,001002,010002,10002,200002,230002]
I love you too.

[010100,10100,200100,230100,20100,23100,21000]
Most undoubtedly.
And remember, keep moving.

[START:0]
Why do you keep coming back?

[START:-0.4]
No, I never really did.

[START:0.4:0.5]
I actually do.

[0:0:1]
I really, truly am.

[0]
I just... don't get it.

[2:0.4:1]
No there aren't.

[2:0.1]
I understand that I'm supposed just accept the comfort of here.

[2:0.2:0.75]
I understand that fundamentally, we're no different.

[2:0.4:1]
I understand that this place is truly no different from life.

[00:1]
What's that you keep saying? Everyone here is the same. If I'm not ready, neither are you.

[00:0.6]
You can't. You'll just have to trust me.

[01,1,20,23]
I still feel the same.

[20,23,21]
Oh. Okay. I thought I had it.

[22]
So... what now?

[22]
I thought there'd be more than this.

[000,001]
Okay?

[010,10,200,230:1:1]
And that's okay. Sometimes we never know. It's time for you to take a break.

[010,10,200,230:-1]
It hurts me to see you like this. And I don't want to fight anymore. I give up.

[221]
So... what now?

[0000,0010,0100,100,2000,2300]
So... what happens now?

[0101,101,2001,2301,201,231,210]
What now?

[220,2210]
I'm free?

[00000,00100,01000,1000,20000,23000:3]
I love you.

[00000,00100,01000,1000,20000,23000:3]
I love you.

[00000,00100,01000,1000,20000,23000:3]
I love you.

[01010,1010,20010,23010,2010,2310,2100]
Will I see you again?
